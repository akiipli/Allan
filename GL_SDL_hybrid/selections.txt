/*
Selections are scene-wide names, that are shared among objects.
Bones are transforms that bind to selections under objects.
Undo system relays on undo actions. This means that program needs
to be server with general command language.
These commands are then saved for every action.
They are saved to produce previous state from current.
They are counteractions. This language then needs command and
arguments. Command is a function pointer, and arguments are
made of some template that corresponds to all needs.
Program itself is interactive, but when it commits a change,
it creates this counter effective command.
