About shadows
Finally got it working.
Alt+S switches shadows on and off.
F5 disables enables shaders.
In Arrays.h Fan_Arrays_Shader switch controls shadow and array rendering for
subdivision level -1. Sometimes application refuses to come up because draw_Fan_Arrays_Shader, 
then set it off and compile.

About include order in main.c

I have all functions in header files, and i provide no function prototypes
when its possible. But sometimes it is necessary to provide a prototype.

To illustrate this theme, lets take a look at Bones.h file.
There is no bone type definition there as it might be expected.

Instead bone typedef is in Transformer.h file. Also selection typedef is there.
This is caused by the fact that Transformer.h uses these definitions and also
Object.h uses them.

As we see, Transformer.h is included as first file in the project after SDL and
library includes.

Also avoid including files especially in these project files except in main.h

Some c libraries are included hovever in UserInterface.h.
Some object creation related includes are in Creators.h.
Dialog.h has more c related includes there.
Cursors.h includes SDL.h file.

About poses

Select deformers first transformer and press r to position it to default pose.
Then update or create pose. Else root position plays as part of the pose.
After that reposition deformer and play deformers poses with Ctrl+D.
